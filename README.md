### Shadab's Bot of Game üéÆ

This project, "Shadab's Bot of Game," is a Python-based automation and input simulation tool. The core functionality is to create a bot that can interact with games or other applications by programmatically controlling mouse and keyboard inputs.

### Features ‚ú®

* **Keyboard Input Simulation**: The project uses the `ctypes` library to simulate keyboard presses, allowing for automated key inputs.
* **Mouse Input Simulation**: It includes functionality to simulate mouse movements and clicks.
* **Structured Input Handling**: The code defines specific `ctypes.Structure` and `ctypes.Union` classes to handle different types of input events (keyboard, mouse, and hardware) in a structured way.
* **External Library Integration**: The project uses a virtual environment (`venv`) and external libraries, demonstrating best practices for dependency management in Python.

### How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

The primary logic is housed in `Shadab.py`. It leverages the `ctypes` library to interface with the operating system's input functions. By defining structures like `KeyBdInput` and `MouseInput`, the code can generate raw input events. The `PressKey` function is a key part of this, as it takes a virtual key code and simulates a press event.

This approach is highly effective for tasks like:

* **Game automation**: Creating bots for repetitive tasks in games.
* **Automated testing**: Simulating user interaction for testing purposes.
* **Accessibility tools**: Building custom input methods for specific applications.

### Getting Started üöÄ

1.  **Clone the repository**: `git clone [repository_url]`
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd Shadab's Bot of Game`
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    * Activate the virtual environment.
    * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming a `requirements.txt` file exists).
4.  **Run the script**: `python Shadab.py`

*Note: The project requires specific OS-level privileges to simulate input. It's recommended to run it in a controlled environment.*
